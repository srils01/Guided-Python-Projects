        <h1>Welcome to Kalabhinaya Dance Academy</h1>
        <p><em>Dance,Art,Passion</em></p>
        <p>Kalabhinaya has been a strong proponent of fostering Indian culture and heritage by teachings of  mythology through dance and spreading knowledge by way of performances. As one of the pioneer Bharatnatyam institutions in the tri-state area, we strive to keep our culture alive and thriving by sticking to our niche.Kalabhinaya is beyond language barriers and is focussed on the sprirituality of the art form rather than the medium in which it is rendered.</p>
